function A_path = compute_A(pi_path)
    % Inputs:
    %   pi_path: [T x 1] inflation path
    % Output:
    %   A_path: [T x 1] aggregate asset demand over time
    
    % Here you would:
    % - Solve the household dynamic programming problem
    % - Simulate agents given the path of prices (incl. pi_path)
    % - Compute the distribution over states
    % - Integrate over individuals to get aggregate A at each t
    
    A_path = zeros(length(pi_path), 1); % placeholder
    
    % ... your code goes here ...
